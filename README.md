# HyperBean â€” Coffee Shop Ordering System

This project is a way to showcase my current programming skills.  
There are currently two ways to interact with it: **Admin** and **User**.

**User:** Can create an account, buy coffee, add funds, and keep track of their transaction history.  
**Admin:** Can view and ban users, add or delete coffee and addons, and update item availability.

> Built with: **TailwindApp**
